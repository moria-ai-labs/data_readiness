Okay, I can help The Prancing Pony Catering define its data domains within its data warehouse and provide the requested JSON output. Here's a breakdown of likely data domains, descriptions, ownership, and a rationale for these choices, tailored to a national, medium-sized catering company with a 2-decade history:

**Rationale:**

The Prancing Pony Catering will likely have a good amount of historical data. We'll focus on data domains that directly impact business operations, revenue generation, cost management, and regulatory compliance. We'll assume a fairly typical departmental structure for a catering company of this size.  The domains are structured to support reporting, analytics, and potential future AI/ML initiatives.

**Data Domain Definitions:**

**Key Considerations for Data Engineering and Governance:**

*   **Data Quality:** Implement data validation rules and monitoring processes to ensure data accuracy and completeness across all domains.
*   **Data Security:**  Apply appropriate security measures to protect sensitive data, such as customer PII and financial information.  Compliance with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) is crucial.
*   **Data Lineage:**  Track the origin and transformations of data as it moves through the data warehouse.  This is essential for troubleshooting data quality issues and understanding the impact of data changes.
*   **Master Data Management (MDM):**  Implement MDM for critical entities like Customers, Suppliers, and Menu Items to ensure consistency and avoid data duplication across different systems.
*   **Data Retention Policies:** Define clear data retention policies to comply with legal and regulatory requirements and to optimize storage costs.

This JSON structure and domain definitions will provide a solid foundation for building and managing the data warehouse at The Prancing Pony Catering. Remember to continuously review and refine these definitions as the company's needs evolve.
